# lucky.py - Opens several Google search results

"""
After doing a Google search, you can see that the result page has a URL like https://www.google.com/search?q=SEARCH_TERM_HERE . 
The requests module can download this page and then you can use Beautiful Soup to find the search result links in the HTML. 
Finally, youâ€™ll use the webbrowser module to open those links in browser tabs.
